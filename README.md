# myroll20macros
My custom roll20.net macros and other tidbits...  
Unless otherwise noted, none of this content requires API access.

Some macros may have special characters replaced by HTML entities due to shortcomings of the roll20.net parser. Any time you open one of these to edit on roll20.net, the HTML entities will be replaced with the encoded symbol. You must revert each of these before saving, otherwise the macro will not function. See [this page](https://wiki.roll20.net/Macros#Advanced_Usage_for_Roll_Queries) for more information.

There is no escape character so newlines cannot be used for clean formatting of macros outside of the drop-down-list syntax. If I discover a way to better format macros in the future, I will update them.

Some of these macros are based on examples from [roll20.net](https://wiki.roll20.net/Macros).
