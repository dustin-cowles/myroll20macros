Mastering others is strength. Mastering yourself is true power.
Even the darkest night turns to dawn eventually... Our sun will rise again.
You can't change the past, but it doesn't mean that the future is decided. What you do right now; that's what will determine the future.
Open eyes are of little use when the mind behind them is closed.
