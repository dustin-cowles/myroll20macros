I hear you grasshopper.
You do not want to do that.
Death is nothing to one who does not fear it.
Engage your brain before you engage your weapon.
A pint of sweat will save a gallon of blood.
The fatal flaw in every plan is the assumption that you know more than your enemy.
To know the battlefield is to anticipate the enemy. To know the enemy is to anticipate victory.
Clear eyes and full hearts can't lose.
Death comes for us all. We can only choose how to face it when it comes.
